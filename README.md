# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matthew Lehner. I've worked in the tech industry for over 20 years. Over my career, I've founded successful businesses and worked in high-growth organizations as an individual contributor and executive. This breadth of experience has helped me understand where my strengths and passion intersect. I'm happiest and most effective when working as an individual contributor in a people-first organization.

I bring a mix of product, engineering, and leadership skills to my day-to-day, and love to ship customer-focused solutionswhile while mentoring and learning from my colleagues. I like being a part of a team and find that I thrive when I feel like I am helping to build resilient, high-performing teams where we all share in our successes and learn from our failures.

For technology, I'm a full-stack developer. I'm just as happy optimizing database queries or writing yaml for a K8S cluster as I am talking with design about vertical rhythm and building UIs that delight.

My preferred tech stack is Elixir/Phoenix/LiveView with Tailwind CSS, some JavaScript, and Postgres deployed to Fly.io or a managed K8S cluster. I've been working with Elixir for almost a decade now. I've also worked extensively with Ruby on Rails, React, Next.js, and TypeScript. I've managed infrastructure on AWS, GCP, and bare metal with Terraform and Ansible.

I'm a great fit for a small, autonomous team that is close to its customers and has a mission to ship great work.
