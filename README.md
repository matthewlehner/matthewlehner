# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matthew Lehner. I've been building stuff for the internet since the 90s, which probably makes me old.

- These days I'm CTO and co-founder at OneFeather where we're working to decolonize the Indigenous experience in Canada.
- I'm currently learning a lot about product management, specifically about how to do effective product management at startup/small team scale, through a Jobs to Be Done lens
- Pronouns: He/Him
- Fun Fact: I have ADHD, which makes me an incredibly empathetic, creative, and strategic person who is very bad at doing the same thing consistently.
